When should you use a histogram?\nQuestion A1.3b.ii: Plot the bar chart that counts the number of participants in each BMI group and save it. Can you give this graph a title? Can you label the y axis and change the colour of the bars in the chart?\nQuestion A1.3b.iii: Plot a histogram of SBP and describe the distribution.\nQuestion A1.3b.iv: Regroup SBP in a different way, and decide which grouping best represents the data.\nQuestion A1.3b.v: Can you change the number of bins used to plot the histogram of SBP? What is the effect of changing the number of bins?\n\n\n1) Bar charts\nAnswer A1.3b.i :\n\nCategorical variables (such as our newly created BMI categories) can be visually represented using a bar graph.\nHistograms should be employed for continuous numerical variables. In our current dataset, variables that could be appropriately represented using a histogram include systolic blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and LDL levels.\n\nAnswer A1.3b.ii:\n\nPlot the bar chart that counts the number of participants in each BMI group and save it.

These would need further investigation to determine if they are valid data points or if they might be errors.\n\nOverall, the normal distribution shape suggests that the majority of individuals in the sample have SBP values within a relatively narrow range, with fewer individuals having much higher or lower values.\nAnswer A1.3b.iv:\n\nRegroup SBP in a different way, and decide which grouping best represents the data.\n\n\n# Remove non-finite values in SBP and convert sbp to numeric\ncleaned_data &lt;- whitehall[!is.na(whitehall$sbp), ]\ncleaned_data$sbp &lt;- as.numeric(as.character(cleaned_data$sbp))\n\n# Define new SBP categories\ncleaned_data$sbp_category &lt;- cut(cleaned_data$sbp,\n                                 breaks = c(-Inf, 90, 120, 130, 140, Inf),\n                                 labels = c(\"Hypotensive\", \"Normal\", \"Elevated\", \"Hypertension Stage 1\", \"Hypertension Stage 2\"))\n\n# Plot the distribution of SBP categories\nsbp_plot &lt;- ggplot(cleaned_data, aes(x = sbp_category, fill = sbp_category)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(title = \"Participants by SBP Category\",\n       x = \"SBP Category\",\n       y = \"Number of Participants\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Hypotensive\" = \"lightblue\", \n                               \"Normal\" = \"lightgreen\", \n                               \"Elevated\" = \"yellow\", \n                               \"Hypertension Stage 1\" = \"orange\", \n                               \"Hypertension Stage 2\" = \"red\")) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n   theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n# Display the plot\nggplotly(sbp_plot)"
